### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
